		<h2>What?</h2>
		<p>
		My goal with my time at Texas A&M is to find problems and projects to work on that I feel are challenging and help people.
		I am currently plan to go to graduate school for a Master's in Electrical Engineering. The main project I am currently working on is my Ultrasound Research.
I have developed interest in a wide variety of problems related to signal processing and statistics.
		</p>

		<h2>So What?</h2>
		<p>My time at A&M has exposed me to so many different ideas and fields within electrical engineering. The challenges I have faced have drawn on similar concepts but each have required their own solution. </p>
		<p>
		I am very excited to get back to learning in person as I feel that I benfit greatly from in person classes.
		</p>

		<h2>Now What?</h2>
		<p>
		My capstone project is my Ultrasound Research. Preparing a bachelor's thesis as well as exposing myself to more specifics in a field will greatly prepare me for graduate school.
		</p>

		<p>
		I am going to graduate school for the purpose of trying to gain more experience in my field while also continuing to explore new ideas and problems I might be interested in working on.
